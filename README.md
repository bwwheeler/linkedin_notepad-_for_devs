# linkedin_notepad-_for_devs
A collection of small code samples for my now-retired "Notepad++ for Developers" course on LinkedIn Learning.

This course is now retired, but the goal was to show how to install interpreters and compilers to let one use the Notepad++ text editor for light coding. All of this nothing but Hello, World-style scripts in a variety of languages, most of which I have only cursory familiarity with.
